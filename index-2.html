                    <p><em>The core objective of this research is to develop innovative methodologies that enable individuals, especially those with limited resources and medical knowledge, to gain insights into skin cancer diseases. By providing accessible technologies, our research endeavors to raise awareness and understanding of skin cancer among the general population, ultimately contributing to the betterment of society.</em><br><em>The project revolves around the utilization of advanced deep learning techniques to create an application capable of accurately classifying skin cancer based on user-uploaded images. This endeavor was motivated by several identified issues that impede the efficient classification of skin cancer and could greatly benefit society and researchers in the field. These issues include:</em><br><em>1.Unawareness of skin cancer diseases among the general population.</em><br><em>2.High costs associated with professional skin cancer classification by clinicians.</em><br><em>3.The need for specialized training and experience in clinical practices like dermoscopy.</em><br><em>4.Limited effectiveness and lower accuracy of existing research on skin cancer classification.</em><br><em>5.Insufficient resources for easy skin cancer detection.</em><br><em>By addressing these challenges through our project, we aim to bridge the gap between medical expertise and public knowledge, enabling individuals to detect and understand skin cancer with greater ease and accuracy. Through accessible resources and advanced deep learning techniques, we strive to enhance early detection, improve patient outcomes, and contribute to the overall fight against skin cancer.</em></p>

                <h1>Face recognition based attendance system<br>&nbsp;(fras)</h1>
                <p>Our project, FRAS, an online attendance system, offers a streamlined alternative. Students can mark their attendance through online sessions, automatically capturing and storing the data in an online database. This database is easily accessible by teachers from anywhere and at any time. The system utilizes a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, SQLite, and Python. The front-end section is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back-end section leverages Django for seamless integration with a PostgreSQL database. Moreover, the recognition system incorporates the 'Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)' algorithm for accurate and efficient attendance tracking.<br><br>By implementing this software, we have created a more secure, user-friendly, and time-saving solution for attendance management. It eliminates the need for manual data entry, significantly reducing the chances of errors and relieving teachers from laborious administrative tasks.<br><br><a class="btn btn-primary" role="button" style="--bs-body-color: #fcfcfc;--bs-primary: #000000;--bs-primary-rgb: 0,0,0;color: var(--bs-tertiary-bg);background: var(--bs-btn-disabled-color);border-color: var(--bs-btn-disabled-color);" href="https://utkarsh-ps.me/FRAS/">KNOW MORE</a><br><br></p>

                    <p><em>I have developed a compelling deep learning project focused on the classification of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9. Through the implementation of a sequential neural network, this project demonstrates remarkable proficiency in detecting and distinguishing various handwritten digits.</em><br><br><em>The model employed in this project exhibits exceptional performance, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 97.97% when tested against a diverse dataset. This accuracy metric serves as a testament to the model's effectiveness in accurately recognizing and classifying handwritten digits.</em><br><em>By leveraging deep learning techniques, our project has unlocked the potential for automated digit recognition, enabling applications in fields such as optical character recognition, automated form processing, and digit-based data analysis. The sequential neural network employed in this project has proven its efficacy in tackling this challenging task with exceptional precision and reliability.</em></p>

                <h1>TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS</h1>
                <p>As part of my course on "Natural Language Processing" on Internshala, I undertook an independent project that focused on sentiment analysis of Twitter tweets. The objective was to create a model utilizing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to analyze the various sentiments expressed by users through their tweets.<br><br>To accomplish this, I gathered a dataset of Twitter tweets, which served as the foundation for training and evaluating the model. LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), was chosen due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies and effectively process sequential data.<br><br>By completing this project, I not only gained practical experience in natural language processing and sentiment analysis but also developed a valuable skill set in utilizing LSTM and deep learning techniques for text classification tasks. This project showcases my ability to work independently, apply acquired knowledge, and contribute to the field of natural language processing.</p>

                    <h2>Digit Classification</h2>
                    <p><em>During my early years of learning deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), I embarked on an independent project in my third year of college. The project focused on creating a model utilizing CNNs to classify the presence of tumors in patients based on MRI scans. To accomplish this, I sourced a dataset from Kaggle, which provided the necessary MRI images for training and evaluation.</em><br><em>The primary objective of the project was to develop a model capable of accurately classifying tumors into three distinct types: Glioma Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, and Pituitary Tumor. CNNs were chosen as the underlying architecture due to their effectiveness in image analysis and pattern recognition.</em><br>Through this independent project, I not only gained valuable experience in applying deep learning and CNNs to medical imaging but also showcased my ability to work independently and develop models for real-world problems. The successful classification of tumors into different types demonstrates the potential of deep learning in aiding medical professionals in accurate tumor diagnosis and treatment planning.<br><br></p>
