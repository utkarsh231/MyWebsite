With an inevitable need for fast screening of the disease, deep learning-based segmentation of Covid-19 infected lung regions in computed tomography (CT) scans gained significant attention. The automated screening procedure generated results significantly faster than the manual screening techniques and directly helped provide a wider outreach to patients. Therefore, to aid in computer-aided diagnoses, this paper presents AUTCD-Net (<strong>AUT</strong>omated framework for efficient <strong>C</strong>ovid-19 <strong>D</strong>iagnosis-<strong>Net</strong>work), based on hierarchical resolution steps, to efficiently segment Covid-19 infected lung regions in CT scans. The approach results in a 0.71 dice score and rivals all previous state-of-the-art approaches. The overall evaluation combined with our in-depth model analysis, and critical inferences can be further extended for developing a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) tool to assist the CT image reading process for detecting Covid-19 infected regions in the near future.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DOI:</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-5090-2_10">10.1007/978-981-19-5090-2_10</a></p>

BC feels like a lump that can be felt different than other BC tissues. Cancer cells spread to other parts of the body by getting into the bloodstream or lymphatic system, which results in BC. It becomes crucial to develop and analyze methods to help understand BC and its trend affecting women. In this paper, we discussed different models to analyze BC tumors and classified them into benign and malignant. Benign tumors are referred to as ‘non-cancerous’ by many, and those that are ‘cancerous’ as malignant. The analysis was done on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD). We performed Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree(DT), Random Forest(RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Artificial Neural Network(ANN) on the dataset and compared their results. Our ANN model yielded the best result among many. All models were compared on various metrics which are Accuracy score, F1 score, Precision score, and Recall score.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DOI:</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ISACC56298.2023.10083642">10.1109/ISACC56298.2023.10083642</a><br><br><br></p>

Specifically, brain cancer (BC) entails the abnormal proliferation of cells within or near the brain. Timely detection plays a pivotal role in effective tumor treatment. Machine learning advancements have significantly aided the medical field in diagnosing brain tumors. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has emerged as a widely utilized and effective machine learning technique for image processing and medical imaging. Nonetheless, many existing classification algorithms exhibit inconsistencies. In recent years, deep learning has exhibited promising outcomes in BC classification. This study focuses on the usage of four popular deep learning algorithms, namely AlexNet, GoogLeNet, InceptionNetV3, and ResNet50, utilizing brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) slices to classify cancerous tumors into Glioma Tumor (GT), Meningioma Tumor (MT), Pituitary Tumor (PT), and No Tumor (NT) categories. The performance of these algorithms has been thoroughly assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Notably, GoogLeNet demonstrates superior results among the four models employed. Additionally, a comparative analysis against various state-of-the-art classification algorithms highlights the enhanced performance of these deep learning models.<br><br></p>

To prevent crop loss and future disease transmission, early detection of plant illnesses is absolutely crucial. The majority of plants, including apple, tomato, cherry, and grapes, exhibit apparent disease symptoms on the leaf. These obvious patterns can be found to accurately forecast the disease and take proactive steps to prevent it. Farmers or plant pathologists manually inspect the plant leaf to determine the type of illness which is the traditional approach. A deep learning model is trained in this research to categorise the various plant diseases. Due to the convolutional neural network (CNN) model's outstanding performance in image-based classification, it is employed. Compared to manual plant leaf observation, the deep learning model makes predictions more quickly and accurately. Sequential CNN model is a solution to make the deployment of deep neural networks on small devices feasible so as to help the farmers with timely detection of the diseases and prevention of crop loss. Numerous experiments for classifying Plant diseases using leaf images confirmed the effectiveness of this architecture in comparison to current approaches, achieving a 99.13% accuracy rate with real-time performance.<br><br><br></p>

It accounts for more than one million new cases diagnosed each year. It is a form of cancer that affects cells of the skin, where they grow uncontrollably and show abnormal changes, thus resulting in a tumor. Although being a severe issue, in many areas with a lack of proper medical and technological facilities, the detection of skin cancer becomes a challenge. Many are unaware of the symptoms and severity of the disease. The probability of recovery is greatly increased by early diagnosis. Through the recent developments of deep learning technologies, the healthcare cost of identifying and classifying skin cancer can be drastically reduced. With this paper, we provide a study of the performance of different deep learning techniques – InceptionV3 Net, Xception Net, and InceptionResNetV2 on the MNIST:HAM (Human Against Machine) 10000 Skin Cancer dataset, with the help of transfer learning. The dataset, originally is imbalanced and to provide the best results, the study has been performed on both imbalanced and balanced datasets. The models have been compared on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. The study shows better results when compared to some state-of-the-art methods. The best working model Xception Net is used to develop a user-friendly Graphical User-Interface (GUI) to help doctors to detect and classify skin cancer in the early stage.<br><br></p>

It results from damage to the optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC). Because of the very slow progression of the disease, symptoms are seldom exhibited at an early stage. Hence an early detection by the correct diagnosis of ophthalmic pathogens can save a person from losing his vision. Evaluation of the optic cup and disc ratio (CDR) plays a crucial role in measuring the progress of glaucoma. Standard techniques involve ocular screening from color fundus image (CFI) through segmentation of optic cup and disc. The two most significant factors in CDR are accuracy in optic disc segmentation, cup and accuracy in optic disc measuring, and cup diameter. The proposed work in this paper reports an improvement in the optic disc and cup segmentation using an attention-guided convolutional neural network. Here a comparison has been made with existing state-of-the-art techniques of image segmentation on the DRISTI gs dataset achieving promising results of dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of +0.4% iou + 1.5% for optic disc and 1.48%iou +3.47% DSC for the optic cup.<br><br><br></p>
